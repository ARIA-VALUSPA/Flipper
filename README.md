#Flipper

This is Flipper, a simple, template-based library for specifying dialogue rules for dialogue systems.
Using XML-templates, you can describe the preconditions, effects and behaviours of dialogue rules.

###Integrating the library in your own project
Flipper is meant to be integrated in your own project. While starting the jar-file will start a template editor, Flipper does nothing on its own.
When integrating it into a project, the user needs to take care of the input (filling a datastructure called the 'Information State'), writing
the templates, and creating classes that perform the output specified in the templates.
